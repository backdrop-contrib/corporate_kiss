Corporate KISS
==============

Corporate KISS is a simple clean theme that is meant to look nice for business
or corporate web sites.  It is written in nothing but pure CSS, with no
template files.  It fully relies on Backdrop's core layout system for layout.

It is written with the philosophy of Keep IT Simple, Stupid.  It's about as
light weight as it can get for a theme.  It is flexible and fully responsive
for all screen sizes, as all themes utilizing the core layout system should be.
It is also designed to utilize wide screens well.  Out of the box, the content
area expands up to 1500 pixels, which can easily be changed.  See the comments
in css/style.css.

To customize, it is recommended that you either create the file, 
**css/local.css**, in the theme directory and add custom CSS there, or use the
[css_injecter](https://backdropcms.org/project/css_injector) module.  The 
local.css file does not exist in the package so that it can be upgraded without
overriding local customizations.
